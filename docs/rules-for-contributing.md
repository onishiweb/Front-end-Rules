How to Contribute
=================

## Rules

Rules should be instructions, i.e. always do _X_. With good examples or details as to what _X_ is...

### Fork/Branch it
You can either fork this repo or clone this repo on your machine and create a new branch.

### New rule, new branch
For each new rule create a new branch.

### Pull request
Submit a pull request to the main repo/master branch on Architect's Github, no rules after the initial few should be added from the main Architect repo.

Add an explanation of what rules you've added and why; include any relevant links for the rules (i.e. a blog post about why it's good practice).

### Review
When there is a pull request, **all** Front End Devs should review the new rules. Either [ship it](http://shipitsquirrel.github.io/), or start a discussion why you think it might not be good for the rules.

## General discussions

If you want to have a general discussion about something (i.e. about how might we propose to do something in the future) and it's not been fully formed as a "rule" yet, create an issue marked [DISCUSSION] and explain what you would like to discuss, after that someone can create a rule from what comes of it.
